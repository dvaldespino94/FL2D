# FL2D
## D FLTK Code generator
### This is just a code generator that consumes _.json_ interface definitions generated by my modified __fluid__ (wich generates a .json copy of the UI)

There are 2 ways of using this:
- As a library:
    + You can generate the code in compile time and use it in your projects.
    + You can generate the code for later use.
- Standalone:
    + You can feed the .json files and it generates the .d code files
